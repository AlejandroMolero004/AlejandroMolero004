    Hello, I'm Alex, a Computer Engineering student at Nebrija University. <br>
    I have a strong passion for programming,<br>
    always looking for new challenges to improve my skills and work on creative projects. <br>
    In my free time, I love diving into the world of video games, both as a player and as someone interested in game development. <br>
    My interest in technology and gaming often inspires me to explore the intersection of coding and interactive entertainment.
